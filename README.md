# Token Consumption Monitor - Coding Test

A React Native for Web application for evaluating full-stack engineering candidates.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
# Press 'w' to open in browser
```

## For Candidates

**Read the full instructions here:** [`/instructions/CANDIDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`](./instructions/CANDIDATE_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

You'll be implementing three safety features for a session billing system:
1. Balance validation before starting sessions
2. Low balance warning system
3. Auto-termination when balance runs out

**Expected time:** 20-35 minutes

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI Library:** React Native Paper (Material Design 3)
- **Navigation:** Expo Router

## What's Pre-Built

✅ Complete UI with Material Design dark theme
✅ Timer that updates every second
✅ Token calculation (already working)
✅ Session state management
✅ Navigation between screens

## What You Need to Build

❌ Balance validation logic
❌ Low balance warning system
❌ Auto-termination when balance depletes

Explore the codebase to find where these features should be added.

## Testing

Three test scenarios are provided in the instructions. Starting balance is 4.0 tokens (refresh page to reset).
